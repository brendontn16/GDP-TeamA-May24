# Story
Kent State University's Computer Science Department Chair tragically goes on vacation in Fiji and liked it too much, never to return. His final command as Department Chair is that his post be left open to anyone in the department - _teacher or student_. But how will the post be filled?

He has a plan for that too. Enter, Kent Fighters: Binary Brawl, where students and teachers in Kent State's Computer Science Department face off in a brutal 1v1 tournament of the ages. Do you have what it takes to defeat the department's fabled faculty and savage students to become the **Department Chair?**
